I have always had a love for computers and technology, ever since I was little I was always fascinated by everything from hardware to the programming that brought it all together. I have been a gamer since I was very young. I remember the days of playing Mario Bros on my NES and then later Donkey Kong on the SNES. I wanted to know more about the game, how it played, how was I able to move the character with the controller, why did some of the levels freeze the frame and other continously pushed you forward, what was the language behind it all? Since then I have watched gaming evolve into the multi billion dollar industry that it is and I knew that I wanted to be a part of that ever changing and evolving landscape.
I have taken classes before on other languages such as Java, C#, and C++. I have even built a very small number guessing and returning 'game' on an android emulator. But nothing compares to the leap that I have taken with the beginning of my journey with Flatiron. I am truly so excited to see where this school can take me within the world of software development.
